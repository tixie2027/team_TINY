## Project Jump Start {.smaller}

Projects give you the space and freedom to design a robot of your own choosing, but there are a few elements that are common across almost all E80 robots:

1.  Autonomous operation and navigation
2.  Running and modifying the provided base software for the robot

To get you up to speed up on these common elements, we'll have a more structured week of lab in the first week after Spring Break.

::: fragment
**Week 4: Bernard Field Station (BFS)**

-   First chance to get field data which is required in the final report.
-   Need a deployment plan and launch checklist.

# Project Launch

## Project Requirements {.smaller}

-   Autonomous deployment for at least one minute with active position control.
-   The deployment must end at a place where the robot can be recovered.
-   Sensor package
    -   Deployed on or from your AUV
    -   Must use at least three sensors with at least two unique electrical interfaces.
    -   The IMU, GPS, and motor current sensors don't count toward your three sensors.

## What we give you to start from

Default Robot code base (under `/Default_Robot/` directory in the Git repository)

Some key pieces:

-   GPS surface navigation
-   Diving
-   Template code for integrating your own custom libraries (`ButtonSampler` library)

## You have a few options for launching at Dana Point

![](img/dana-point-map.png)

Kayaks are also available to accompany your robot out into the center of the harbor.

## Resources: Staff Time

-   Profs in lab hours
-   Profs in office hours
-   Engineering assistant hours
-   Proctor hours

## Resources: Stuff

-   Anything in lab – sign out expensive stuff & submit error reports for anything that breaks.
    -   The E80 main PCBs and protoboards
    -   E80 frames, boxes and penetrator bolts
-   Stuff outside lab: \$50 budget per team as long as you follow purchasing instructions

## Resources: Strict Purchasing Protocol

-   Must be checked off by two instructors before buying
-   Each team has only one designated buyer, all purchases from that one person
-   Submit engineering purchase request form
    -   Include team number
    -   Specify Prof. Brake as approver
    -   Specify purchase is for E80
-   We almost never agree to rush shipping … plan around 5-7 days lead time.

## Resources: Where can I buy Stuff?

-   Electronics – Digikey, Mouser, JameCo, SparkFun, Adafruit
-   Mechanical – McMaster-Carr

### Tips

-   Make sure you consider package type! Buy adapter boards for surface mounted (SMT) parts.
-   Make sure that you only buy parts that are in stock.

## Resources: Our Waterproof Boxes

- Can fit about 6 wires in a penetrator bolt.
- Drill on flat faces of box: need flat rubber washers on box surface.

## Considerations when Picking Sensors {.smaller}

**Package type** – thru hole vs. surface mount w/ adapter board

**Interface**

# Final Project Design Exercise

## Project Ideation Activity

Recall the steps of the Engineering Design Process.

![](img/stanford-hexagons.png)

## Two dispositions for thought processes

![](img/diverging-converging-thought-processes.png)

## Round 1: What do you want to measure?

-   What do you want your robot to measure?
-   Broadly in two categories: scientific and engineering relationships
    -   Scientific examples: water quality, distribution of temperature, salinity, turbidity
    -   Engineering examples: sensor accuracy, battery life, sensor or craft mechanical durability, velocity vs. power

## Instructions

-   Split into groups and find a big Post-It for your team
    -   Write your team number on the top
-   Write down any quantities that you think would be interesting to measure with/on your robot.
-   Focus on quantity over quality—we’re going for as many ideas here as possible.
-   Feasibility doesn’t matter (yet)!

## “Yes, and” wild stories

## Round 2: Give feedback on delightful ideas

-   Split your team in half. Half move to the big sticky on the right, half move to the big sticky to the left.
-   Use the dots to vote for the idea(s) you find most delightful or fascinating (do NOT consider feasibility at this point).
    -   You get 3 votes each
    -   You may vote for the same idea more than once.

## Round 3: How do you want to measure it?

-   Review the feedback you got from your classmates’ dot votes.
-   Select 3 ideas that you wish to explore further.
-   For each idea, sketch a plot of the key figure that you hope to generate as the result of your project.

## Think about the axes of your measurements

-   What is the **dependent** variable?
-   What is the **independent** variable?

+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| ![](img/example-axes.png)     |![](img/example-plot.png){width="540"} |
+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------+

## Round 3: How do you want to measure it? {.smaller}

-   What are your...
    -   Independent variable(s): e.g., $t$, $x$, $y$
    -   Dependent variable(s): e.g., $y(t)$, $z(x,y)$
-   Specify for each variable
    -   Units
    -   Expected ranges
    -   Resolution required (e.g., sampling frequency in time/space, sensitivity)

## Round 4: What instrumentation will you use?

For each desired quantity, list out any ways that you can think of to measure that quantity.

-   What is the transduction method (e.g., electrical, mechanical, chemical, combination, etc.)
-   What types of sensors might you use? Think about what you’ve used or seen in E80 so far for inspiration.

## Final Presentation and Report {.smaller}
