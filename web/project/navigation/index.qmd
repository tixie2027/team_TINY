## Introduction

This week we're doing work in lab that is designed to accelerate you into the project.  We are going to structure the work like a lab from the first half of the class -- there are videos, a quiz and a submission sheet -- but the goal is to provide you the tools you need to start right away on your project.  Specifically, we want you to leave this Jump Start with an autonomously controlled robot and a confident attitude towards understanding and modifying the robot code.

Though this week's activity looks like a lab. there are several crucial differences from a standard lab.  

- There will be no resubmissions allowed for lab 7 material. You're done with this activity at the end of your lab session this week.
- Consequently, grading standards are going to be a little gentler for lab 7 materials.
- You don't have to do all parts of this lab. See more discussion below.

In this lab, every team is going to do some activities to learn about your robot software, then test out using IMU data to dead reckon a course, which is an echo of the work that you did in lab 1.  After that, your team will select one of the following activities to pursue during this lab, each of which are designed to help prepare you for different types of projects:

- **Diving Activity**: In this activity you will build a pressure sensor and a P control loop for robot depth.  You will test your loop in the tank.  Pick this if you plan to have your robot dive or use a depth-controlled winch.  It is possible that there will be a queue for the tank if many students in your section are doing the diving activity.  Feel free to start on your robot [build](/labs/build) while you are waiting.
- **Surface Navigation Activity**: In this activity you will use GPS and your magnetometer to control the bearing of your robot, and you will test that navigation system by walking around with your robot outside of Parsons.  Pick this if you plan to do surface navigation, if you intend to have your robot keep station (stay still), or if you plan to do a hybrid diving/surface navigation scheme.

After successful completion of this lab, you will be able to:

- [ ] Understand the basic structure of the E80 robot code and be able to define vocabulary words used to describe that structure like: setup function, loop function, service, object, and library
- [ ] Modify your robot's serial output so you can inspect variables of your choice in your software
- [ ] Accurately discuss and calculate the effects of error accumulation on IMU dead reckoning
- [ ] Use a sensor appropriate to your chosen type of navigation: either the GPS and IMU or a pressure sensor
- [ ] Modify and use the example robot code and the C++ libraries that we provide.

## Software and IMU (All Teams Do this)

This section consists of some exercises to help you understand the E80 robot code followed by an exercise to explore the noise performance of the IMU.

### Set up a Team Github Repository

Though E80 doesn't require you to do a lot of software modification, it's a good idea to make sure that your team is all able to work from the same code base.  Modern best practices for doing so involve using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control in conjunction with a web-based remote repository like [Github](https://github.com/).  In this section (which can be completed entirely during prelab), your team will set up a shared repository so you can all work on the same code.

1. All team members should [make a Github account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github).  
2. Optional: Consider [applying for Student access](https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-global-campus-for-students/apply-to-github-global-campus-as-a-student), which unlocks advanced Github features while you're a student.
3. One team member should 
    1. Run a fetch and pull operation on the current E80 repository using Github Desktop (just to make sure you have the most up-to-date code).
    2. [Make a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories), 
    3. [Invite your team](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) to the new repository.
    4. Clone your new repository [using Github Desktop web integration](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) or [typical clone commands](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
    5. Populate your new repository with all of your E80 code by copying and pasting it from your E80 repository folder to your new repository folder.
    6. Commit and push your copied and pasted code to the new repository.
    7. (Git savvy students will note that there are slicker ways to track both the E80 repository and your team's work, for instance by forking the E80 repository. We're doing this because it's easy and we expect to push few software updates.)
4. All other team members should clone the new repository (see links above).
5. All team members should tell Arduino to look for sketches in the new repository by editing `Settings -> Sketchbook Location`.

:::{.callout-tip}
We'll be linking to specific files on the E80 Github repository below to talk about them, but remember that you downloaded all the Arduino and library files for this class in both your E80 repository and now in your team's repository. So don't download them again from the links, just edit the files in place on your machine.
:::


### Familiarize Yourself With the E80 Software

Read this section and make the requested modification to your code. We recommend reading this section with your E80 software open in a code editor (VScode, Sublime, Notepad++, etc., NOT MS Word) so that you can look for features of the code as we discuss them.  We also think **every member of your team should do this section** even though you'll only turn in one submission sheet.

The E80 robot code appears in three files: `E80_Lab_07_dive.ino`, `E80_Lab_07_surface.ino` and `Default_Robot.ino`.  We intend for you to use `Default_Robot.ino` on your final project, but you should modify `E80_Lab_07_dive.ino` and `E80_Lab_07_surface.ino` this week. (The dive and surface programs are simplified versions of `Default_Robot.ino`, so they're easier to learn from.)  Look at `E80_Lab_07_dive.ino` in this section.

The E80 robot code all has the `.ino` suffix, which means it is encoded in Arduino files (Language [tutorials](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage) and [reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/)), and as such these files have two extremely important functions: `setup()` and `loop()`.  The `setup()` function is run once when your robot powers on, and then the robot runs the `loop()` function over and over until power is removed.  

The `loop()` function contains several `if` statements that dispatch to functions.  We call these functions "services", and each represents one thing that the robot is doing.  The functions used in many services are defined in libraries, which are described below. 

The E80 robot code uses `#include` statements at the top to include functionality that is written in C++ (Language [tutorials](https://www.learncpp.com/) and [reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)), and we call each such C++ file a "library".  Libraries can be found in our `libraries/main/` folder, and they usually consist of a C++ file (e.g.: `SensorIMU.cpp`) and a header file that the C++ file `#include`s (e.g.: `SensorIMU.h`).  However, some library files only provide constant values, and therefore only have header files (e.g.: `TimingOffsets.h` or `Pinouts.h`).  Usually we invoke a library function to in at the top of the `.ino` file to create a special variable called an "object", and then we ask that object to use its functions to perform a service.

We can put these ideas together with an example: at line 150 a service called `adc.updateSample()` is called, and this service samples and records the Voltage on all of the analog pins.  The `if` statement at line 148 guarantees that this functions is called exactly once per `LOOP_PERIOD`, which is a constant you can look up (or change!) in `TimingOffsets.h`. The `adc` object is created asa global variable on line 40.  The `adc` creation code (the `init()` function) and the `adc.updateSample()` function are defined in the `ADCSampler.cpp` library, which depends on `ADCSampler.h`.

To put our new understanding to the test, we are going to edit the serial message that the robot displays each cycle.  

1. Run the `E80_Lab_07_dive.ino` code and look at the printed display by opening the serial monitor.
2. Modify `SensorIMU.cpp` so that the String returned by the `printRollPitchHeading()` function includes the X magnetometer value.
3. Modify `E80_Lab_07_dive.ino` so that it displays the output of the `printState()` function of `ButtonSampler.cpp` on line 2 of the message instead of the `printStates()` function of `ErrorFlagSampler.cpp`.
4. Run the `E80_Lab_07_dive.ino` code again and look at the new printed display to see your changes.  Note that your changed libraries should be automatically recompiled when you recompile your `.ino` file. Press the user button on the E80 motherboard to see the `ButtonSampler.cpp` library at work.

Finally, look at `TimingOffsets.h` to figure out how often your main loop runs, which sets how quickly you sample data with the ADC, IMU, etc.

:::{.callout-tip}
You generally should not include calls to `Serial.println()` in your code, even though it's standard practice for Arduino, because it messes with our `printer` object.  The `printer` takes great pains to keep all the text easy to read as the robot spits out updates, and random print statements can cause it to jitter around.  Use `printer.printMessage()` for one time messages (see `DepthControl.cpp` for an example) and `printer.printValue()` to print recurring values (as seen in the `loop()` function of the E80 code).
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
Be sure to read the `README` in the libraries folder because it contains a lot of information about the features and adjustable knobs in each file. The adjustments described in the `README` file are sufficient to cover most standard student projects, so you might not even need to write code.

For instance, the README contains this important deep cut for the project: It is possible to increase the logging time of your robot by increasing the FILE_BLOCK_COUNT value in Logger.h. This can help you to log data during long deployments.

## .cpp vs. .h vs. .ino

Exploring the code in this section highlights some of the interaction between the header (`.h`), library (`.cpp`), and Arduino (`.ino`) files. The header files are the interfaces, they hold information on variables that are used in other files and the functions of the library files of the same name. The library files are the implementations of the functions defined in the headers, and they use the variables held in the headers. The Arduino file sketch is the top level of the program, and it invokes library functions and header variables to implement the desired behavior of the robot.

### Position Measurements via IMU

In this section we'll use our board stack and our IMU to try to calculate position by integrating noisy acceleration data.  As the lecture videos suggest, the noise is likely to make this position measurement fail.  We're hoping to see a concrete demonstration of that principle.

1. Power your motherboard with a battery 
2. Run stock `E80_Lab_07_dive.ino` code without your modifications from last section, or run `Default_Robot.ino` if you don't want to roll changes back.  Make sure your [IMU](https://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/74/c4/19/54/62/c5/46/13/DM00177685.pdf/files/DM00177685.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00177685.pdf) is producing sensible accelerations by turning it around in the air and, if need be, reviewing your [lab 1](/labs/lab1/) results.
3. With the data logger running, move your motherboard along a linear path in the horizontal x-y plane, keeping the orientation fixed. In other words, create your own global Cartesian coordinate frame on a table, set the position of the board stack to be (0 m,0 m,0 m), set the orientation of the board stack to be (0°, 0°, 0°). Then, move the board stack through the following positions: (0 m, 0 m, 0 m), (0.5 m, 0 m, 0 m), (0 m, 0 m, 0 m). Don't move too fast, and note that it may help to wait 5 seconds at the (0.5 m, 0 m, 0 m) coordinate.
4. Using MATLAB, load the IMU data and calculate the position of the board stack as a function of time by integrating accelerations. 
5. Plot the x,y coordinates of the board stack and comment on whether the plotted path resembles the straight 0.5 meter path.
6. Plot the y coordinates vs. time and include appropriate measures of uncertainty for integrated values. 


## Diving Activity

In this activity, you will design a P control loop that interacts with a pressure sensor to control the robot's depth.  You will need to modify `E80_Lab_07_dive.ino` and the [E80 C++ libraries](https://github.com/HMC-E80/E80/tree/main/libraries/main) to do so.  

### Calibrate and Test a Pressure Sensor

In order to implement closed loop depth control with your AUV, it first needs to be able to sense its current depth, which we will do by interpreting a pressure sensor. You have two options to make your pressure sensor: build the pressure sensor from your project proposal on a breadboard, or use one of our pre-made pressure sensor adapter PCBs ([picture](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LEGhYjHPmEy7TEqDj1MgLXBuiTXaycc3), [schematic](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KLr1kXQqwAI7urwtZSGdn_CvxM2G_UvH), [layout](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1L3BF7umlX180xhOMnQ9K8Ubop1LF_Auk), [KiCAD](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JyV-FahVbUNkURrN65v0to_McqpwAE12)).  We recommend building your own design to get a start on your project [build](/project/build), but feel free to use our PCB if you're short on time.  (Do note that our PCB uses a weird op-amp circuit that you'll need to analyze on your own.)

In a deviation from previous practice, you will measure the operation of this sensor using your Teensy.  By measuring your pressure directly in the Teensy, you can write code that interacts with your results in a direct way.  We will take advantage of the serial data

1. Attach your pressure sensor output to pin A0 on the Teensy.
2. Add a line showing your current pressure measurement to your robot's serial report. Edit `updateState()` in `ZStateEstimator.cpp` by uncommenting the two lines of code below the calculation of the z position. 
3. Run `E80_Lab_07_dive.ino`. The pressure sensor Voltage should now appear in the serial monitor, and you will use that display to calibrate your pressure sensor.
4. Use a graduated cylinder and a meter stick with pressure tubing attached to make a calibration curve with at least seven points between depth and Teensy-reported Voltage.
5. Modify `depthCal_slope` and `depthCal_intercept` in `ZStateEstimator.h` so your Teensy display reports the proper depth in meters.


### Write a P Control Algorithm for Depth

Add a Proportional depth control system to your robot by modifying the `DepthControl.cpp file`. Add the following steps:

1. Assign the desired depth to a variable named `depth_des`. The desired depth can be found in the `wayPoints` array at the index `currentWayPoint` (i.e.: at `wayPoints[currentWayPoint]`).
2. Assign the current depth to a variable `depth`. The current dept can be found in the `state.z` variable. 
3. Calculate the error, `depth_error`, as the difference between `depth_des` and `depth`. Pay attention to the order you subtract `depth_des` and `depth`, because a sign error here can make your P control push _away_ from the desired waypoint.
4. Set the vertical motor control effort, `uV`, to be the product of the control gain, `Kp`, and the error, `depth_error`. The default value of Kp is 0, so you need to change it in `DepthControl.h`.  `Kp=80` is usually pretty good, but tune it up or down if your motor is too weak or too strong.
5. Bound the vertical control effort between -200 and 200.  These are empirical values that work well for most situations.  Depending on your motor, you may need to go beyond these limits.  You can go up to a maximum of +/- 250.

:::{.callout-tip}
You usually need to declare variables in C++, but all the variables in these instructions have already been declared in `DepthControl.h` (go look for yourself), so you don't need to declare them here.

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Details About the Code

In the library file named `ZStateEstimator.cpp`, in the function called `ZStateEstimator::updateState()`, you can see that the z position (depth) of the robot is calculated using the function’s input `pressure_signal`. The main `loop()` of the Arduino code is where `z_state_estimator.updateState()` is called. By reviewing this `loop()`, you can see that this `pressure_signal` input is receiving the output of `analogRead(PRESSURE_PIN)`. `analogRead()` is an Arduino function that reads the value of a specified pin, and `PRESSURE_PIN` is a variable set in `Pinouts.h`, currently set to pin A0 (pin 14) of the Teensy. The `pressure_signal` input provides the pressure sensor signal in Teensy units. The `ZStateEstimator::updateState()` function then converts from Teensy units to Volts, then finally converts from Volts to depth [m] using the variables `depthCal_slope` and `depthCal_intercept`. This depth measurement is stored in `state.z`. 
:::

### Test the P Control Algorithm

Test your depth P control using the meter stick with tubing and the graduated cylinder. 

1. Attach the pressure tubing to your pressure sensor and run `E80_Lab_07_dive.ino`.  
2. While  is running with the serial monitor open, insert the meter stick into the cylinder 
3. Keep an eye on the `Depth_Des:`, `Depth:`, and `uV:` values printed to the serial monitor. 
    1. Make sure that the `Depth` is reporting a similar value to the current depth of the meter stick to confirm that your calibration works. 
    2. Watch the control effort `uV` change as the difference between `Depth` and `Depth_Des` changes, making sure it behaves as expected for proportional control.

Improve your P control test by adding a motor to your robot.

1. Get an E79 umbilical (found in the lab room) and attach it to your robot.
2. Put the motor in the vertical position, and use a ziptie to secure the tube to the frame.
3. Connect the tubing to your pressure sensor and the motor wires to the Motor C port on your motherboard.
4. Run E80_Lab_07.ino while the serial monitor is open.
5. Watch the motor and the reported control values: 
    1. The motor should start spinning to get to the first waypoint at 0.5 meters.  If the motor is spinning too fast for you to see what's going on, you can reduce `Kp`.
    2. Check if it’s rotating in the correct direction; if not, switch the wires on your motherboard (or change the order you subtracted the `depth` and `depth_des` to get the error in `DepthControl.cpp`, or change the sign of `Kp`).
    3. Blow in the pressure tubing and confirm that the depth changes, and that the motor responds to the change in depth.

Finally, once everything is tested and working, deploy the robot in the tank.

1. Bring your robot to the tank room, run `E80_Lab_07_dive.ino`, and put the robot into the tank.  Watch out for splashes onto your computer or motherboard as you put the robot in.
2. Let the robot go to the two depth waypoints at 0.5 m and 1 m while keeping an eye on the values and messages printed to the serial monitor. Be sure to log your data. 
3. Plot the logged `uV`, `depth` and `depth_des` as a function of time.

::: {.callout-warning}
Be careful with the umbilical because it may not have enough slack for the robot to go down to 1 meter. If that’s the case, you can change the depth waypoints in the `setup()` function of `E80_Lab_07.ino`. If your robot’s motor is too strong or too weak, you may need to change your `Kp` in `DepthControl.h`.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
You can instruct the robot to stay at each depth waypoint for a specified amount of time by changing the `diveDelay` variable defined in the `setup()` function of `E80_Lab_07.ino.`.  For example, setting `diveDelay = 3000` will tell the robot to wait at each depth waypoint for 3 seconds before continuing.
:::


## Surface Navigation Activity

In this activity, you will design a P control loop that interacts with a magnetometer and GPS sensor to control the robot's angle.  You will need to modify `E80_Lab_07_surface.ino` and the [E80 C++ libraries](https://github.com/HMC-E80/E80/tree/main/libraries/main) to do so.  

### Magnetometer Calibration

A magnetometer measures the earth's magnetic field, so it can be used as a compass to sense your robot's heading. Read [this](https://digilent.com/blog/how-to-convert-magnetometer-data-into-compass-heading/) article describing how it works. We have a magnetometer integrated into our IMU.  Every magnetometer has errors in its measurement, which can be byproducts of manufacturing or of local magnetic disturbances (eg: the magnetic declination is -10.52° at Mudd). You need to calibrate those errors out before you can trust your magnetometer results. This [article on magnetometer calibration](https://github.com/kriswiner/MPU6050/wiki/Simple-and-Effective-Magnetometer-Calibration) is a good summary of the process.

1. Take your robot outside, far from buildings, run `E80_Lab_07_surface.ino`, and log your magnetometer data while your robot is held upright and you slowly (over ~10s) rotate 360 degrees while standing in place. Save the logged data from this exercise for later. 
2. Program your Teensy with our magnetic calibration software -- [Mag_Calibration.ino](https://github.com/HMC-E80/E80-SP2023/blob/main/Mag_Calibration/Mag_Calibration.ino) -- and use [Mag_Calibration.m](https://github.com/HMC-E80/E80-SP2023/blob/main/MATLAB/Mag_Calibration.m) to extract the hard and soft iron correction coefficients. You will need MATLAB version 2018b or later to run this code. Save the figure generated by `Mag_Calibration.m` to your submission sheet. 
3. Update the `mag_offsets` and `mag_comp` variables in `SensorIMU.h` with the hard and soft iron coefficients you just measured. 
4. Run `E80_Lab_07_surface.ino` and turn in a circle outside again. Also save these magnetometer readings. 
5. Generate the following two plots: 
    1. A scatter plot of mx vs. my where your calibrated and uncalibrated data are superimposed. Find appropriate units for the axes in `Mag_Calibration.m`.
    2. A plot of heading vs. time for both your calibrated and uncalibrated data.   

### GPS Integration

Integrate the [Adafruit Ultimate GPS](https://www.adafruit.com/product/746) into the motherboard 

1. Solder a 9x1 female header pin row onto the motherboard at the position labelled GPS (see [Lab 1](/labs/lab1/) for details). 
2. Try to find an assembled GPS.  If you can't find one, then solder male header pins to the BOTTOM of the GPS breakout board. Be sure to get the orientation correct; @fig-gps-on-board shows the correct orientation. 
3. Use screws, nuts, and standoffs to help secure the GPS breakout board to the motherboard.

![A motherboard with a GPS attached. The GPS here doesn't have standoffs in the left two holes, but you should add those on your board.](img/mtb_v3.0_cropped.jpg){#fig-gps-on-board}

Go outside the building and test your GPS Sensor integration by opening the serial monitor while `E80_Lab_07_surface.ino` is running. Make sure your battery is plugged into the motherboard because your GPS is powered off the battery (NOT off the USB connection that powers your Teensy). Make sure you achieve GPS lock and see >4 satellites.

### Write Latitude and Longitude Software

Modify the library file `XYStateEstimator.cpp` so that it calculates the x,y position (in meters) of the board with respect to a Cartesian coordinate frame whose origin is at ( 34.106465°, -117.712488°). Consult the `XYStateEstimator.h` file to see what variables you have available. Design your coordinate frame so the X axis points due East and the Y axis points due North. The code to make this transformation should be placed in the function named `updateState()` in `XYStateEstimator.cpp`, and the calculated positions will be stored in the variables `state.x` and `state.y`. To do this, we will use a modified version of the [Forward Equirectangular Projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection), where we multiply use the radius of curvature `R_earth` to scale latitude and longitude angles in order to calculate arc lengths on the Earth's surface. This conversion assumes that the earth is a sphere (which it is to within ±0.25%). 

While we're here, we have a little work to do to calculate yaw correctly. In this class we are using east-north-up [local tangent plane coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_tangent_plane_coordinates). This means that you need to convert the heading from the IMU, which should have 0 degrees due North and positive angle in the CW direction, to yaw angles where 0 degrees points in the positive X direction (due East), and positive angles are in the CCW direction. If 0 degrees doesn't face perfectly East, (which is location dependent due to abnormalities in the Earth's magnetic field), you can add an offset angle to ensure it does. Put code to make this conversion in `XYStateEstimator.cpp` in the `updateState()` function. Store the result in `state.yaw`.

1. To calculate `state.y`, use the relationship between the distance along an arc's edge, the radius of the arc, and the angle, (e.g. `state.y = R_earth*latitudeChange`). 
2. To calculate `state.x`, note that it is a function of latitude, (e.g. `state.x=R_earth*longitudeChange*cos(latitude at origin)`).
3. To calculate `state.yaw`, add an appropriate offset to `state.heading` and, if necessary, multiply some part of your expression by -1 to flip around a sign.

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Latitude and Longitude Background

It may help to first make sure you are aware of how longitude and latitude work. This [link](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/latitude-and-longitude) is helpful and has a nice image to help visualize the coordinate system. There are several algorithms that have been used to convert longitude-latitude coordinates to x-y coordinates. There is the [Vincenty formula](http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong-vincenty.html), the [Haversine equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula), and linear transformations that simply scale the coordinates. The first two methods incorporate the curvature of the earth which is important when the vehicle is traveling many kilometers. Scaling methods are easier, but can only be used if distances are short. A good reference can be found [here](http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html).
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
You usually need to declare variables in C++, but all the variables in these instructions have already been declared in `XYStateEstimator.h` (go look for yourself), so you don't need to declare them here.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
The most common programming mistakes that we see are messing up units (is this angle in degrees or radians?), and failing to re-map angles between -$\pi$ and $\pi$ after they are calculated. Letting an angle be $3\pi/2$ will crash a lot of your code unless you're very careful.
:::

### Position Measurements via GPS

To test that your sketch is functioning well, log the x,y positions (they are logged by default in the sample code) as you walk from the coordinate system origin to Foothill Blvd. 

1. Run `E80_Lab_07_surface.ino` outside and ensure that you achieve GPS lock and are logging reasonable GPS data. It takes time (sometimes a few minutes) before the GPS receiver gets a lock on the signals from the satellites.  The GPS lock LED can help you identify if your board has achieved lock.
2. Walk the following path
    1. Start at the origin defined above
    2. Walk along the sidewalk East towards Shanahan. 
    3. Walk South between Shanahan and Parsons. 
    4. Cut West back to Parson's building and end at the origin. 
    5. The path is illustrated in @fig-gps-test. You may want to have the serial monitor open (and print x,y to the screen) when walking the course.  This will inform you if your conversion makes sense.  
3. Using MATLAB, plot the logged x,y positions from the path. Only plot the x,y points for which the GPS has a lock on satellites.  Overlay these points on an image of campus using the `imread` and `image` Matlab commands in addition to normal plotting functions.  The `hold on` command may help.

![A path to walk to test the GPS.](img/GPS_test_2.png){#fig-gps-test}

### Proportional Surface Control

In this section you will implement a Proportional surface control system with your AUV using the GPS on your motherboard. Use `E80_Lab_07_surface.ino` as the starter code for this portion.  You will also interact with two new library files: `SurfaceControl.cpp` and `SurfaceControl.h`. 

Add a Proportional surface control system to your robot by modifying the `SurfaceControl.cpp file`. Add the following steps:

1. Confirm that you can compile and upload the starter code to your Teensy before you make any changes.
2. Calculate the desired yaw angle using the `atan2` function. i.e. `yaw_des = atan2(y_des - y, x_des - x)`. In this case, `(x_des, y_des)` is the desired position of the robot.
3. Calculate the error, `yaw_error`, as the difference between `yaw_des` and `yaw`. (Which you just calculated based on `state.heading` above).
4. Set the control effort, `u`, to be a product of the control gain, `Kp`, and the error, `yaw_error`.
5. Set the right and left motor thruster values (`uR` and `uL`) to be the `avgPower + u` and `avgPower - u` respectively. 
6. Modify `SurfaceControl.h` to set `avgPower` to be 50 by default. This can be modified later if you want your robot to have faster or slower forward motion.
7. Multiply `uR` and `uL` by `Kr` and `Kl` respectively, (e.g. `uR = uR*Kr;`) to give you a way to account for uneven motors. The default values for `Kr` and `Kl` are 1.0, but you can change them later if your motors don't run at the same speed when given the same PWM signal. 
8. Bound the `uR` and `uL` control values to be between 0 and 127.

As above, the header file (in this case, `SurfaceControl.h`) takes care of variable declarations for you.

Test your P control by walking the campus while trying to obey the commands given by `uR` and `uL`. 

1. Make sure the path defined is in the code to be the three x,y coordinates (125,-40), (150,-40), (125,-40). This should walk you 25 meters along the centerline of campus (see @fig-p-path). 
2. Go to the origin. 
3. Walk at a slow speed, turning in response to the u_R and u_L values printed to the Serial monitor. If the the values are `uR=45` and `uL = 55`, then veer right to try to equalize `uR` and `uL`. Be sure to save your logged data.  
4. Plot the logged path of x, y points on top of an image of campus. Also plot the angle error and control effort u as a function of time.

Finally, if you have time, attach motors to the Motor A and Motor B port and repeat the above experiment, this time obeying your observations of the motor's rotation rates rather than the printed u_R and u_L values.  Modify Kr and Kl if necessary to balance your motors. Pay special attention to how motors affect your yaw measurement: they give off powerful magnetic fields that are likely to interfere with your experiment if you don't handle them with care.  No plots are required for this extra activity, but it can give you insight into how your robot will perform during the project deployments.
