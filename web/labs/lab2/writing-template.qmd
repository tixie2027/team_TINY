Insert the schematic used to make your measurements here.
Note that your schematic should include any additional components needed to represent any output impedances of sources or input impedances of measurement devices.

Insert table here containing measurements across different resistance values *with the same instrument*.

Text to explain what the table above means.
The text should address and highlight:

-   Trends in the data
-   Unexpected results
-   Conclusions to be drawn
