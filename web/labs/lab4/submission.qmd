Several of the deliverables in this submission sheet will call for schematics, oscilloscope traces or circuit pictures.  These are specific genres of technical documents, so they have conventions you need to adhere to.  The specifications for all schematics, oscilloscope traces and circuit pictures are listed on this page instead of being repeated for each deliverable in the document.

All schematics in this report should adhere the following specification:

- [ ] Include the stimulus for the circuit on the left
- [ ] Include power supply connections and bypass capacitors.
- [ ] Annotate each node with a name, using the name Vin for the input voltage and Vout for the measured output voltage
- [ ] Annotate each resistor and capacitor with a component value.
- [ ] Use implicit connections to connect the power supplies.
- [ ] Use the op-amp symbol to indicate operational amplifiers (instead of, e.g., a pinout diagram), but annotates that symbol with the chip used to make the op-amp.
- [ ] Represent op-amp circuits in their typical configurations, so that they look similar to videos.  Don't use non-typical drawings that make one type of op-amp circuit look like another.  (e.g.: don't draw a non-inverting amplifier with feedback on the top of the op-amp; that's usually how inverting amplifiers are drawn.)
- [ ] Generally keep signal flow left-to-right
- [ ] Generally keep high voltages at the top of the diagram and low voltages at the bottom.
- [ ] Space out components well enough and zoom in close enough that annotations are easy to read.
- [ ] Minimize unnecessary crossings, corners and jogs in the wires.  Use connect-by-name to reduce congestion among wires.  This [tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-read-a-schematic/reading-schematics) has more information.

All pictures of circuits in this report should adhere to the following specification:

- [ ] Picture is taken at a level of lighting and zoom that allows a reader to trace connections in the circuit.
- [ ] The circuit is neatly laid out so that readers can trace connections in the circuit.
