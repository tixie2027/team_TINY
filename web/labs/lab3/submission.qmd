Several of the deliverables in this submission sheet will call for schematics, oscilloscope traces or circuit pictures.  These are specific genres of technical documents, so they have conventions you need to adhere to.  The specifications for all schematics, oscilloscope traces and circuit pictures are listed on this page instead of being repeated for each deliverable in the document.

All schematics in this report should adhere the following specification:

- [ ] Include the stimulus for the circuit on the left
- [ ] Include power supply connections and bypass capacitors.
- [ ] Annotate each node with a name, using the name Vin for the input voltage and Vout for the measured output voltage
- [ ] Annotate each resistor and capacitor with a component value.
- [ ] Use implicit connections to connect the power supplies.
- [ ] Use the op-amp symbol to indicate operational amplifiers (instead of, e.g., a pinout diagram), but annotates that symbol with the chip used to make the op-amp.
- [ ] Represent op-amp circuits in their typical configurations, so that they look similar to videos.  Don't use non-typical drawings that make one type of op-amp circuit look like another.  (e.g.: don't draw a non-inverting amplifier with feedback on the top of the op-amp; that's usually how inverting amplifiers are drawn.)
- [ ] Generally keep signal flow left-to-right
- [ ] Generally keep high voltages at the top of the diagram and low voltages at the bottom.
- [ ] Space out components well enough and zoom in close enough that annotations are easy to read.
- [ ] Minimize unnecessary crossings, corners and jogs in the wires.  Use connect-by-name to reduce congestion among wires.  This [tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-read-a-schematic/reading-schematics) has more information.

All oscilloscope traces in this report should adhere to the following specification:

- [ ] Show each of the requested quantities on a separate oscilloscope channel.
- [ ] Scale the horizontal axis so 3-10 cycles of the input/output voltage waves are visible
- [ ] Scale the vertical axis to maximize size of the input/output waves without clipping
- [ ] Make sure the input/output waves use the same 0 V reference voltage.
- [ ] Be exported using the screen capture function of the oscilloscope.  Phone pictures of oscilloscope data are unacceptable.  (Note that in a normal lab setting it would be essential to also capture CSV output from the oscilloscope for later mathematical processing.  No need to do that in this lab, screen captures are fine.)

All pictures of circuits in this report should adhere to the following specification:

- [ ] Picture is taken at a level of lighting and zoom that allows a reader to trace connections in the circuit.
- [ ] The circuit is neatly laid out so that readers can trace connections in the circuit.

## Report on the Design and Characterization of a Turbidity Meter

Effort:

- [ ] Provides a picture of the prepared solutions in cuvettes.  Picture is annotated to indicate turbidity of each cuvette.
- [ ] Provides a picture of the assembled turbidity meter.

Complete: 

- [ ] Provides two sets of oscilloscope traces showing 555 timer output, 90° transimpedance amplifier output and transmission transimpedance amplifier output.  
  - The traces are gathered while a solution of middling turbidity is in the turbidity meter, so both 90° and transmission outputs are visible. 
  - The first set of traces are gathered under normal lighting conditions.
  - The second set of traces are gathered under shadowed lighting conditions.
- [ ] Plot of Vpp,90/Vpp,Transmission vs. Turbidity values annotated with uncertainty measures.
- [ ] Plotted turbidity data shows a linear relationship so measured Voltages can be used to predict turbidity.
- [ ] 2-3 sentences explaining why we use a switching LED, why we measure peak-peak Voltages in the transimpedance outputs, and why those decisions are related to ambient light.
